    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salisbury steaks with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon mustard powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, 1/3 cup condensed soup, bread crumbs, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Shape into 6 oval patties.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add patties and brown on both sides. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Blend remaining soup and flour together in a small bowl until smooth; mix in ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Pour soup mixture over patties in the skillet. Cover, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    </ol>
