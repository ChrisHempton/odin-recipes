# odin-recipes

This is my first project on the Odin Project.

Before this, I've gone through the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course and I made it half way through Anegela Yu's full stack web dev course on Udemy.

I switched to this in hopes that it would be much more hands-off and I wouldn't fall into the "tutorial hell" of video-based learning. So far, so good.

This website will be built using basic HTML to display recipes.
